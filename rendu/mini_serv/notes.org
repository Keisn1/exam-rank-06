#+title: Notes

- a client may not read the messages from the server
  - in that case I shall not disconnect them

working
1. Client connects to the server
   - client gets new id (starting at 0)
   - clientId = lastClientId + 1
   - a message is sent to all the client that was connected to the server: "server: client %d just arrived\n"

2. clients must be able to send messages to your program
   - message will only be printable characters, no need to check
   - a single message can contains multiple \n
   - when the server receive a message, it must resend it to all the other client with "client %d: " before every line!

3. When a client disconnect from the server:
   - a message is sent to all the client that was connected to the server: "server: client %d just left\n"
